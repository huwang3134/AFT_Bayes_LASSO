Zhang, Z., Sinha, S., Maiti, T., and Shipp, E. (2016) Bayesian variable selection in the AFT model with an application to the SEER breast cancer data. To appear in the *Statistical Methods in Medical Research*. [Preprint](http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~sinha/research/draft_seerdata_Dec_2015_rev2_sent2pub.pdf)
